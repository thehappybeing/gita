# Introduction

There have been a number of iterations of Bhagvad Gita. Different people at different walks of life at different times have come up with a translation and explanation of the Gita. And yet, it remains as elusive as ever.

What is so amazing about this book that it has garnered interests of people young and old. And why is this still considered as one of the best books of Spirituality?

The reasons are diverse. But one of the most important reason is that the way Krishna explains Arjun about the world, and that too amidst the scene of war in the background - it gives us reason to see our own life in that war.

## Why another translation?

This book is not meant to be another translation of Gita, or maybe it is. But the thing is, I have read a lot of the versions of Gita - and yet none of them answered 100% of the questions I had. Besides, a lot of those versions invoked concepts that seemed illogical to my rational mind.

Now if something that you need doesn't exist, the best way forward is to create it. That is what this Gita is about.
